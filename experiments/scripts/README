[First]
132 x 132 png files, WITHOUT any standalone '1_x' images
==========================
png pixel size 132
train_size 3730
test_size 3169
anchor_size [8, 16, 32]
feature stride size [16,]
logfile slurm-2153455.out, slurm-2155783.out, slurm-2156848.out

[Second]
132 x 132 png files, plus additional 3845 standalone '1_x' images,
all of which are added to the training set (trainsecond.txt). Thus,
trainsecond.txt = train.txt + additional_3845
The testing set remains the same (test.txt)
==========================
png pixel size 132
train_size 3730 + 3845 = 7575

[Third]
132 x 132 png files, plus additional 3845 '1_x' images, 2411 of which are added
to the training set (trainthird.txt), and 1434 of which are added to the
testing set (testthird.txt).
==========================
png pixel size 132
train_size 3730 + 2411 = 6141
test_size 3169 + 1434 = 4603
anchor_size [8, 16, 32]
feature stride size [16,]
logfile slurm-2163554.out, slurm-2164344.out

[Thirdsmall]
The same as [Third] except that using a smaller anchor scale and a smaller
feature stride size. Training set becomes (trainthirdsmall.txt), which is just
a symbolic link pointing to trainthird.txt. The reason is only to make the name
different to the system. Testing set (testthirdsmall.txt) is also a symbolic
link to testthird.txt
============================

[Fourth]
500 x 500 png files, plus additional 3845 '1_x' images, 2411 of which are added
to the training set (trainfourth.txt), and 1434 of which are added to the
testing set (trainfourth.txt).
